Party Finder (Client)

This is the client for the Party Finder app. Note that this is still in early development and not quite ready for any sort of production use. I will update this readme with installation and running instructions once this is ready
for even an alpha run :)

### Technologies

- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) as the shell for the desktop application
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as the component framework of choice
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) for state management
- GraphQL with [apollo-client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) to help manage all that
